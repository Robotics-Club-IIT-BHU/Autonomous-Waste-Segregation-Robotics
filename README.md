# Autonomous Waste Segregation Robotics
# INTRODUCTION
Although still a major portion of the population relies on manual labour at work in dump yards and landfills for manual sorting of waste into recyclable waste or not it cannot be denied that it poses a great risk to the workerâ€™s health. For this reason and for a much smoother and efficient handling and sorting of waste materials many countries have come up with Autonomous solutions with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to sort and segregate recyclable waste items.
